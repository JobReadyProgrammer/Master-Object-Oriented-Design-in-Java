## About the course :

- SUPER CHARGE OF YOUR PROGRAMMING CAREER and acquire some seriously marketable skills!
- Just because you learned how to use a hammer doesn't mean you are ready to construct a building.
- Similarly, It's not enough to just understand a programming language. That's just a tool that can be used to develop various programs. The real craftsmanship is in software DESIGN.
- This course is designed to take a junior level programmer with limited knowledge about object orientation to a competent level object oriented software designer!
- I expect you to understand the basics of loops, methods and conditionals in Java.
- You'll be completing hands-on HOMEWORK Exercises through out the course!
- I have provided detailed video solutions to the exercises so that you can check your answers and get step by step instructions on how to tackle the object oriented design assignments.
- You can find plenty of resources online for solving a programming puzzle or practicing algorithms. But… when it comes to object oriented design, admittedly, there is limited material out there for you to practice.
- So in this course, we use a LEARN-BY-DOING  approach to explore a series of progressively challenging exercises to  discover the 5 core object oriented design PRINCIPLES summarized by an acronym called SOLID.
- During this journey you'll get practice applying some of the most important DESIGN PATTERNS that competent developers must have under their belt.
- There are so many design patterns out there, but we'll be thoroughly covering only the most important ones.
- Save yourself the time from learning all the design patterns and going on a design frenzy. Focus on the 20% that covers 80% of the scenarios and add miles to your programming efficiency.  

## Topics covered in this course :

The topics can be applied to pretty much any object oriented language. 
- But, we'll be using Java, so I expect you to be familiar with the basic language constructs such as classes, methods and interfaces. 
- But don't worry if you don't know about these, I've taken the time to create 6 comprehensive prerequisite lessons on introduction to object orientation. 
- In these lessons, new comers can learn about the basics of object orientation such as:  
  - 1). Classes and objects
  - 2). Inheritance and polymorphism,
  - 3). Interfaces and abstract classes.    
- SOLID Principles:
  - (S). Single Responsibility
  - (O). Open/Closed
  - (L).  Liskov Substitution
  - (I ). Interface Segregation
  - (D). Dependency Inversion    
- Design Patterns:
  - Strategy Pattern
  - Observer Pattern
  - Builder pattern
  - Factory method pattern
  - Template Method Pattern
  - Singleton Pattern  

I'm certain that, by practicing the concepts covered, you'll make a substantial leap forward in your programming career. I hope to see you in the coming lessons.
